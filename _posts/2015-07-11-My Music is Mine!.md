#"Let me play you my new favorite song" said *The Verge* as I glanced at my trusty tech tabloid one morning.

Instantly I recognized the album art as *Foals*' excellent *What Went Down*. I felt this inexplicable anger and my day suddenly became worse by two missed doses of caffeine. I wondered why I was angry.

It was pretty obvious. 

This was *my* favorite song. 

It didn't matter that there were already half a million plays on Spotify alone. (Maybe Foals frontman Yannis Phillippakis should [give them more credit](http://www.nme.com/news/foals/73488 "NME.com<This tab plays music>").) It didn't matter that this is a *bona fide* good song that will garner a number of fans.

It mattered that someone else was advertising to the world *my* favorite song as *his* favorite song. 

I had discovered it a full day and a half before him. I had listened to it about fifteen times already. I'd been following the band for years - I didn't need Apple Music&trade; and its oh-so-special Beats&trade; Radio 1&reg; to make my discovery for me. Oh no, it was *my* favorite song all right. Not his.

###We get possessive about music.

I asked myself if it was just me being a giant jerk. The internet quickly came to my rescue - there's been [prior art](http://wrongplanet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=67979) here. 

It happens all the time - an excellent example cited in the link goes something like this: one of your best-kept-secret bands receives major radio airplay with a breakthrough single and suddenly people are telling other people about this great new band they just discovered. And you have an urge to scream at the top of your lungs **"OMG IT'S NOT A NEW BAND I'VE KNOWN THEM FOR YEARS STOP ACTING LIKE YOU DISCOVERED A NEW CONTINENT"**.

###Why do we get possessive about music?

The responses in the link show two interesting angles to this. One, that we connect with some pieces of music so much that they're special to us and there's a debilitating fear of being judged. Two, and this is more nuanced, we treasure the fact that few others know about what you know  - this unheard-of band - and it's your special secret, and the secret becoming common knowledge without your consent is akin to what kids feel when they realise their mommy isn't the only one in the universe.
